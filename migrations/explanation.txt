migrate create -seq -ext=.sql -dir=./migrations create_movies_table

In this command:
1: The -seq flag indicates that we want to use sequential numbering like 0001, 0002, ... for the migration files (instead of a Unix timestamp, which is the default).
2: The -ext flag indicates that we want to give the migration files the extension .sql.
3: The -dir flag indicates that we want to store the migration files in the ./migrations directory (which will be created automatically if it doesnâ€™t already exist).
4: The name create_movies_table is a descriptive label that we give the migration files to signify their contents.
